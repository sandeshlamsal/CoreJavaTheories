platform independent
-------------------
The .java file is written once in a windows can be compiled 
with JVM for linux, unix, windows any platform to generated its .class
and can be run any where.  for .class it has to be environment specific.



Diff between c++ and Java
--------------------------
-java do not have pointers to memory.
-java to not have structures,unions but class and objects.
-java has JVM to deallocate memories but in c++ u have to do it.
-java does not have multiple inheritance, but support it through interfaces.


is java pure object oriented language?
--------------------------------------
Java is not because it supports Primitive datatype such as int, byte, long... etc, to be used, which are not objects.

There are seven qualities to be satisfied for a programming language to be pure Object Oriented. They are:
1. Encapsulation/Data Hiding
2. Inheritance
3. Polymorphism
4. Abstraction
5. All predefined types are objects (int i=0; is not valid but not in java)
6. All operations are performed by sending messages to objects
7. All user defined types are objects.
